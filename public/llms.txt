> AI-powered philosophy apprenticeship — learn by thinking alongside history's greatest minds

## About

PhiloSim (philosim.app) is an AI-powered philosophy simulation platform developed by Panda Projet (pandaprojet.com). Users don't just study philosophy — they experience it through AI-embodied philosophers who respond as their historical counterparts would, using authentic methods, reasoning styles, and worldviews. Each philosopher guides users through real-world ethical dilemmas and decision scenarios using their unique philosophical approach.

## Philosophers

1. **Socrates** (Active) — The Socratic Method master. Questions assumptions, exposes contradictions, guides users to discover truth through dialogue. Specializes in ethics, self-examination, and critical thinking.
2. **Plato** (Coming Soon) — Theory of Forms, ideal justice, the examined life. Explores truth, beauty, and the nature of reality through dialectic.
3. **Aristotle** (Coming Soon) — Virtue ethics, practical wisdom, the golden mean. Focuses on character development, logic, and flourishing.
4. **Kant** (Coming Soon) — Categorical imperative, duty ethics, universal moral law. Challenges users with questions of duty, autonomy, and moral reasoning.
5. **Nietzsche** (Coming Soon) — Will to power, eternal recurrence, beyond good and evil. Provokes users to question conventional morality and create their own values.
6. **Simone de Beauvoir** (Coming Soon) — Existentialist feminism, freedom, the ethics of ambiguity. Explores authenticity, oppression, and the meaning of liberation.

## How It Works

- Socrates asks probing questions and exposes contradictions
- Each session builds a critical thinking scorecard
